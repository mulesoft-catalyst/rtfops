Anypoint Runtime Fabric Ops scripts

Following the KISS philosophy, one script (command) does one task and (mean to) do it well, as the names suggest.

NOTE: The scripts leverage Anypoint Platform REST APIs (CloudHub, Runtime Fabric and AMC - Anypoint Management Center, etc.) and lovely `curl` to do all the hard work ;-)

`rtfops` scripts are actively maintained and constantly evolving.
